    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Fettuccine Alfredo or fettuccine al burro is an Italian pasta dish of 
        fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and parmesan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 ounces (140g) grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, plus more for sprinkling</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (3g) cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest (optional)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound (450g) fresh fettuccine, or 12 ounces (340g) dried fettuccine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 1 medium clove)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Minced fresh parsley or chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cheese, heavy cream, egg, cornstarch, olive oil, and lemon zest (if using) 
            in a large bowl. Season lightly with salt and heavily with black pepper and whisk 
            to combine. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add pasta and cook, 
            stirring frequently to prevent sticking, until cooked but still very firm 
            (not quite al dente), about 45 seconds for fresh pasta or 1-2 minutes less than 
            package directions indicate for dried pasta. Drain pasta into a colander set over 
            a large bowl. Transfer 2 cups (480ml) of cooking water to a liquid measuring cup 
            and discard the rest. Transfer pasta to the now-empty bowl. Add garlic and butter 
            and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Whisking constantly, slowly add 1 1/2 cups of pasta cooking water to bowl with 
            cheese mixture. Transfer cheese mixture to the now-empty pasta cooking pot, 
            scraping the bottom to make sure you get everything. Cook over medium-high heat, 
            stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until mixture comes to a boil and thickens,
            about 45 seconds. Season sauce to taste with more salt and pepper as desired. 
            Transfer pasta to sauce mixture and turn to coat. Just before serving, stir in more 
            pasta water to thin sauce out as necessary. Serve immediately, sprinkle with 
            minced herbs, black pepper, and cheese, and drizzle with additional olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
