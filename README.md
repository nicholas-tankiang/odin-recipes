# odin-recipes

A practice html project using recipes from SeriousEats. 

Live: https://nicholas-tankiang.github.io/odin-recipes/

Project focuses on making html boilerplate, utilizing internal links and images, and basic stylization (unordered and ordered lists). 

Future improvements: 
>Add links that go back to main page. Clicking a recipe leads to a dead end page.
